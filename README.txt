If you have a restaurant you know how important Yelp reviews can be. Yelp may have started with just restaurants, but now they have all sorts of businesses. If you have a great rating on Yelp, then it's a great idea to display the reviews on your site. By showing social proof from Yelp you can build customer confidence and increase your sales.

If you don't have any Yelp reviews, then don't worry it's pretty easy to get started. More than likely your Business is already listed. All you have to do is starting sending your customers there to leave a review.
